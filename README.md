# ✂️ Odin Rock, Paper, Scissors

A console-based game to play the classic 'rock, paper, scissors' against the computer. Will you win? 

This project is the first in the JavaScript Foundations track through The Odin Project. I used global variables and `for` loop logic, but avoided arrays, per the assignment guidelines. It represents my first dive into JavaScript fundamentals through Odin.
